Class Outline - implementation.

Initially the rendering algorithm was designed by David Turner and the
other authors of the FreeType library - see the above notice. I nearly
created a similar renderer, but still I was far from David's work.
I completely redesigned the original code and adapted it for Anti-Grain
ideas. Two functions - renderLine and renderScanline are the core of
the algorithm - they calculate the exact coverage of each pixel cell
of the polygon. I left these functions almost as is, because there's
no way to improve the perfection - hats off to David and his group!

All other code is very different from the original.
