Authors of kconfig-frontends.

The developers of the Linux kernel are the original authors of the kconfig
parser and frontends. The list is too long to reproduce here, but you can
get a pretty complete list from the Linux kernel repository logs:
    git shortlog scripts/kconfig

The packaging uses the GNU autotools build system, of which I
will not try to list the many authors here.

The initial packaging was done by:
    "Yann E. MORIN" <yann.morin.1998@free.fr>

For a complete list, see the commit-logs of the kconfig repository.
