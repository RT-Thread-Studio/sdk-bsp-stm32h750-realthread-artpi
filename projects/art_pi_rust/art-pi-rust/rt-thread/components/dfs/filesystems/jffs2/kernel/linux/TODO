This contains a very limited set of Linux-compatibility headers, initially
just for getting JFFS2 to build.

Some things are simply stubs which don't _work_, to allow the JFFS2 code
to compile. Note that you may need to implement these _properly_ in order
to use these for making other Linux code work, or indeed for making the 
JFFS2 NAND support work.

The non-working parts include, but are not limited to: 
	workqueue.h, wait.h, timer.h, spinlock.h, sched.h, compiler.h
