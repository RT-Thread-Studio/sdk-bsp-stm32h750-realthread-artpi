STM32Cube programming software for STM32 microcontrollers
=========================================================

Features
========
 • Supports Motorola S19, Intel HEX, ELF, and
   binary formats
 • Erases, programs, views and verifies the
   content of the device Flash memory
 • Supports debug and bootloader interfaces:
   – ST-LINK debug probe (JTAG/SWD)
   – UART and USB DFU bootloader interfaces
 • Programs, erases and verifies external
   memories, with examples of external Flash
   loaders to help users to develop loaders for
   specific external memories
 • Automates STM32 programming (erase, verify,
   programming, configuring option bytes)
 • Allows OTP memory programming
 • Supports the programming and configuring of
   option bytes
 • Offers a command-line interface
 • ST-LINK/V2 firmware upgrade
	
Description
============
STM32CubeProgrammer (STM32CubePROG) is a full-
featured software interface for programming 
STM32 microcontrollers. It provides an 
easy-to-use and efficient environment for 
reading, writing and verifying device memory 
through both the debug interface(JTAG and SWD)
and the bootloader interface (UART and USB). 
STM32CubeProgrammer offers a wide range of 
features to program STM32 microcontroller 
internal memories (such as Flash, RAM, and 
OTP) as well as external memories. 
STM32CubeProgrammer also allows option 
programming and upload, programming content 
verification, and microcontroller programming
automation by means of a command-line interface.
STM32CubeProgrammer is delivered in GUI 
(Graphical User Interface) version and CLI 
(Command Line Interface) version.
